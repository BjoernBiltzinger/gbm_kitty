Database, reduce, and analyze GBM data without having to know anything. Curisoty killed the catalog.

## What is this?

* Creates a MongoDB database of GRBs observed by GBM. 
* Heuristic algorithms are applied to search for the background regions in the time series of GBM light curves. 
* Analysis notebooks can be generated on the fly for both time-instegrated and time-resolved spectral fitting. 

## What this is not

Animal cruelty.
